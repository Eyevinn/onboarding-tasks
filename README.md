# Welcome
First of all, we are happy to welcome you as new developer and consultant at Eyevinn Technology. The purpose with the following tasks is to get you quickly on-board to be able to contribute to the company and the video streaming open source community.

Our manifesto is that whenever we have the possibility to release our code as open source we should. Source code under non-disclosure agreement and where the intellectual property belongs to our customers are of course not released.

Read through these tasks and you can skip the tasks that you are already quite familiar with.

## 1.1 Create a Github account

If you don't already have a Github account create an account by following the instructions here: https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/

We recommend that you enable two-factor authentication

Once your account has been created send the username you have chosen to Jonas Birm√© on Slack or E-mail who will then add you to our organization on Github. If you are totally new to Git or Github we recommend you to take the time and read through the articles here: https://help.github.com/articles/good-resources-for-learning-git-and-github/

## 1.2 Fork our html5 dash analyzer/player

Now you should be quite comfortable with Git and Github and ready to contribute. Begin with creating a fork of our HTML5 DASH analyzer / player: https://github.com/Eyevinn/html5-dash-player

Instructions on how to fork a repository can be found here: https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/

It is a HTML5 MPEG DASH-player built on Google's Shaka Player and is a simple NodeJS Express application. Once you have the player up and running browse through the code and repository that you forked and see if you find anything to contribute with. It can be a simple task such as modifying or adding a README file or a more complex task to add a new feature of your choice. It is completely up to you what you choose to do.

When you have decided what you want to do continue with next steps

## 1.3 Create a topic branch

Create a topic branch in your forked repository for the addition that you decided to do. Instructions on how to create a topic branch can be found here: https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/

## 1.4 Issue a pull request

In your topic branch implement the feature and verify it works. Then issue a pull request, and instructions on how to do that can be found here: https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/

Your pull request will then be reviewed and if everything looks good it will be merged upstreams. Congratulations!

## 2. Install our streaming toolbelt

There a couple of tools that are useful to have at hand when working with video and streaming. We have a Docker image prepared with a couple of these tools pre-built. Install the toolbelt by following the instructions available here: https://github.com/Eyevinn/docker-toolbelt

And if you have any suggestion on what should be added to the toolbelt file an issue in the above repository or even better make your own contribution.

## 3. Install our development Docker image

In addition to the streaming toolbelt Docker image we also have a development Docker image which you can use to build for example ffmpeg. This image come with most of the build dependencies already installed. 

## 4. Make a contribution to the community

Browse through Github to find a relevant repository / project in the video streaming area which you can contribute to. When you have found the project to contribute to then:

 1. Fork the repository
 2. Create topic branch
 3. Implement feature
 4. Issue pull request
 
Congratulations! You have now made your (first) contribution to the video streaming open source community.
